# How to Use Google Data Studio

## Overview
This slide presentation is designed to help non-technical teams understand how to use Google Data Studio for building interactive dashboards and data reports. 
This workshop was a practical session presented to a team of Product Managers to enable them to become more autonomous regarding data visualization within their squads. It was conducted in 2019 and may be outdated.
Additionally, since the workshop used the clientâ€™s own data for hands-on exercises, I am unable to share those specific materials for now.

Note: Google Data Studio is now known as Looker Studio, and some features or functionalities may have changed. I plan to review and update the content in the future to ensure it reflects the most current version.
