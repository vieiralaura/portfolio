# 🕵️‍♂️ Fraud Detection and Risk Assessment in Digital Banking Transactions

## 📝 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing transaction data from a digital bank mobile app to identify potential fraud and develop risk classification rules. The analysis aims to evaluate transaction events, classify risk levels, and provide actionable insights to enhance fraud detection mechanisms.

## 🗂️ Dataset
The analysis utilizes two datasets:
1. **Transaction Events Dataset**: Contains information about each transaction event, including:
  - `transaction_id`: Unique event identifier
  - `transaction_timestamp`: Timestamp of the event in milliseconds
  - `transaction_value`: Monetary value of the transaction in reais (R$)
  - `account_id`: Identifier of the associated account
  - `device_id`: Identifier of the device used for the event
  - Additional features related to device integrity and authentication.
2. **Fraud Dataset**: Lists transactions that resulted in fraud, used for validation purposes.

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook or any other IDE
- SQL (if applicable)

## 🔍 Methodology
1. **Descriptive Analysis**: Conduct an in-depth analysis of transaction events, identify data quality issues, and propose data cleaning solutions.
2. **Fraud Risk Classification**: Develop a set of rules to classify transactions into high, medium, and low risk based on the descriptive analysis findings.
3. **Evaluation of Classification Rules**: Apply the classification rules to the dataset and assess the effectiveness of the rules using the fraud dataset for validation.
4. **Recommendations**: Provide insights on optimizing fraud detection while minimizing impact on user experience.

## 📊 Analysis Steps
- Load and explore the datasets.
- Conduct descriptive statistics to identify patterns and anomalies.
- Develop fraud risk classification criteria based on the analysis.
- Apply classification rules to assess transaction risks.
- Evaluate the impact of classification on transaction approval rates and financial implications.

## 📈 Results and Key Findings
- Identified key patterns in transaction events associated with fraud.
- Developed robust classification rules for fraud risk assessment.
- Analyzed the financial impact of the fraud detection strategy on user experience and transaction outcomes.

## 💡 Recommendations
- **Enhance Risk Assessment Rules**: Refine classification rules to improve accuracy and reduce false positives.
- **User Experience Optimization**: Implement user-friendly verification processes to minimize friction during legitimate transactions.
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Establish ongoing monitoring systems to adapt to emerging fraud trends and tactics.

## 📝 Conclusion
This comprehensive analysis of transaction events and fraud detection mechanisms provides critical insights into potential vulnerabilities within digital banking processes. By adopting the proposed recommendations, the digital bank can enhance its fraud prevention strategies while ensuring a positive user experience.
