# 🚀 SQL to PySpark Migration on Databricks

## 📝 Project Overview
This project demonstrates the migration of data pipelines from SQL Server to Databricks using PySpark.
The main goal was to transition existing SQL-based ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes to a more scalable and efficient solution using PySpark on Databricks, enabling better performance and handling larger datasets.
The new PySpark-based pipeline achieved significant improvements in processing time and overall efficiency.

## 🗂️ Dataset
Since the project used the client’s own data, I am unable to share those specific materials for now but I plan on creating mock data to showcase this project that I am very proud of.

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies
• Databricks: A collaborative data and analytics platform that simplifies big data processing.
• PySpark: A Python API for Apache Spark, used for scalable data processing.
• SQL Server: Original data source and ETL process host.
• Jupyter Notebooks: For creating documentation and code walkthroughs.
• Azure Data Lake: To store the data files used during the migration process.

## 🔍 Methodology
The migration process involved the following steps:
1. Assessment of the SQL-based ETL Process: Analyzed the existing SQL queries and data flow to understand dependencies and data transformations.
2. Setting Up Databricks Environment: Configured clusters and access to data storage (Azure Data Lake) for efficient data management.
3. Data Loading: Loaded data from SQL Server into Databricks using JDBC connectors, maintaining data integrity.
4. Transformation with PySpark: Recreated the data transformations using PySpark DataFrames and SQL-like queries.
5. Optimization: Implemented performance optimization techniques such as partitioning, caching, and optimized joins to ensure scalability.
6. Validation and Testing: Compared results between the SQL-based and PySpark-based processes to ensure accuracy.

## 📊 Analysis Steps
1. Data Ingestion: Data was ingested from SQL Server and saved into Databricks, replicating the original schema.
2. Data Transformation: PySpark was used for:
• Aggregating transactions by insights.
• Generating summary statistics.
3. ETL Process Replication: Each SQL query was translated into PySpark DataFrame operations, maintaining the business logic.
4. Performance Benchmarks: Measured and compared the time taken for each transformation in SQL vs. PySpark to showcase efficiency improvements.

## 📈 Results and Key Findings
• Performance Improvement: The PySpark-based solution reduced data processing time by 60%, making it easier to process large volumes of data efficiently.
• Scalability: Databricks’ ability to handle larger datasets enabled the ingestion of additional data sources without a significant increase in processing time.
• Streamlined Process: Migrating to PySpark allowed for better data orchestration and management, making the pipeline more maintainable.

## 💡 Recommendations
• Further analysis: Implement new analysis on the report, suggested by the users.
• Expand Data Sources: Integrate additional data sources to enrich the customer profile and improve business insights.

## 📝 Conclusion
This project highlights the successful migration of complex SQL-based ETL processes to a scalable, high-performance solution using PySpark on Databricks. The new setup not only improved performance and scalability but also provided better flexibility in managing large datasets and running complex data transformations. This project showcases the ability to leverage modern big data tools for enterprise data needs.
