# BMI Calculator with Interpretations
# Add some if/elif/else statements to the BMI calculator so that it interprets the
# BMI values calculated.
# If the bmi is under 18.5 (not including), print out "underweight"
# If the bmi is between 18.5 (including) and 25 (not including), print out
# "normal weight"
# If the bmi is 25 (including) or over, print out "overweight"
# Refer to this graphic for help:

    
weight = 85
height = 1.85

bmi = weight / (height ** 2)

if bmi < 18.5:
    print("underweight")
elif bmi < 25:
    print("normal weight")
else:
    print("overweight")
