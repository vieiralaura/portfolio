  ### Comparator Operators
		* `>` Greater than
		* `<` Less than
		* `>=` Greater than or equal to
		* `<=` Less than or equal to
		* `==` Equal to
		* `!=` Not equal to

## Execercises
1) Odd or even
Create a code using what you have learnt about the modulo operator and conditional checks in Python to check if the number in he input area is odd or even.
If it's odd print out the word "Odd" otherwise printout "Even".

See [odd-or-even_calculator.py](./odd-or-even_calculator.py) for the solution code.

2) BMI Calculator 
The body mass index (BMI) is a measure used in medicine to see if someone is underweight or overweight.  
Create BMI calculator and add some if/elif/else statements to the BMI calculator so that it interprets the BMI values calculated.

See [bmi-calculator.py](./bmi-calculator.py) for the solution code.

3) Python Pizza
Write a Pizza Delivery Program that based on a user's order, work out their final bill.
Use the `input()` function to get a user's preferences and then add up the total for their order and tell them how much they have to pay.

See [python-pizza-delivery.py](./python-pizza-delivery.py) for the solution code.

4) Ticket price
Create a program that calculates a ticket price for rollercoaster based on user input.

See [ticket-price_calculator.py](./ticket-price_calculator.py) for the solution code.

## Chanllenge
Build a "Chose your own adventure game".
Using what you have learnt in the lessons today you will be building a very simple version of this type of text game.
