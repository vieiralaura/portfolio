# Day 05 - Python Loops

## Key Concepts
  - For Loops
  - Number functions (sum, max)
  - For Loops with Range
  - Password Generator Project

## Execercises
1) Highest Score
You are given a list of exam scores, and you have to print out the highest score from the List whithout using the max() function.
See [highest_score.py](./highest_score.py) for the solution code.

2) The Gauss Challenge
Work out the total of the numbers between 1 and 100, inclusive of both 1 and 100.
See [gauss.py](./gauss.py) for the solution code.

3) FizzBuzz
Write a program that automatically prints the solution to the FizzBuzz game
See [fizz-buzz.py](./fizz-buzz.py) for the solution code.

## Challenge: Password Generator
Create a password generator! The objective is to take the inputs from the user to these questions and then generate a random password. 
Use your knowledge about Python lists and loops to complete the challenge.

### Easy Version
Generate the password in sequence. Letters, then symbols, then numbers.

### Hard Version
In the advanced version of this project the final password does not follow a pattern.

## Solution
See [password_generator.py](./password_generator.py) for the solution code.
