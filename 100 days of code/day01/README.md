# Day 01 - Working with Variables in Python to Manage Data

## Key Concepts
- Print function
- Concatenating strings
- Errors: how to deal with them and how to find solutions using stackoverflow and Google search
- Using `input()` to get user input
	- Remember that `input()` always returns a string, so you must convert it using `int()` if you want to perform mathematical operations
- Indentation importance
- How to make comments
	- "CTRL + /" to comment a whole block of code
- Best coding practices and PEP8

## Challenge
Create a program that suggests a band name based on user inputs of city and pet's name
