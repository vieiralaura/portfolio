# ðŸ’ª This is a difficult challenge! ðŸ’ª 

# You are going to write a function called calculate_love_score() that tests the compatibility between two names.  To work out the love score between two people: 

# 1. Take both people's names and check for the number of times the letters in the word TRUE occurs.   

# 2. Then check for the number of times the letters in the word LOVE occurs.   

# 3. Then combine these numbers to make a 2 digit number and print it out.
