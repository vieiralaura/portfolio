# üêç 100 Days of Code - Python Bootcamp by Angela Yu

## üìù Project Overview
The ‚Äú100 Days of Code‚Äù Python Bootcamp by Angela Yu is a comprehensive course aimed at building proficiency in Python through a hands-on, daily practice approach. Over the course of 100 days, each module focuses on different aspects of Python programming, ranging from basic syntax to advanced projects, helping learners to build a solid foundation and practical skills in Python.

## üóÇÔ∏è Dataset
This course includes a variety of datasets and code examples, each tailored to specific lessons or challenges. Some projects involve datasets like:
- CSV files for data manipulation exercises.
- APIs for learning how to work with real-time data.
- JSON files for working with structured data.
- Game data for projects like text-based games or graphical applications.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Technologies
- Python: Main language for the bootcamp.
- Jupyter Notebook: For interactive coding sessions.
- PyCharm / VS Code / Spyder: For project-based exercises.
- Git: Version control for tracking progress.
- GitHub: Repository for sharing code and documentation.
- Flask: For building simple web applications.
- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.

##üîç Challenges
