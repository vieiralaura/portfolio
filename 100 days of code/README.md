# üêç 100 Days of Code - Python Bootcamp by Angela Yu

##üìù Project Overview
The ‚Äú100 Days of Code‚Äù Python Bootcamp by Angela Yu is a comprehensive course aimed at building proficiency in Python through a hands-on, daily practice approach. Over the course of 100 days, each module focuses on different aspects of Python programming, ranging from basic syntax to advanced projects, helping learners to build a solid foundation and practical skills in Python.

## üóÇÔ∏è Dataset
This course includes a variety of datasets and code examples, each tailored to specific lessons or challenges. Some projects involve datasets like:
‚Ä¢ CSV files for data manipulation exercises.
‚Ä¢ APIs for learning how to work with real-time data.
‚Ä¢ JSON files for working with structured data.
‚Ä¢ Game data for projects like text-based games or graphical applications.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Technologies
‚Ä¢ Python: Main language for the bootcamp.
‚Ä¢ Jupyter Notebook: For interactive coding sessions.
‚Ä¢ PyCharm / VS Code: For project-based exercises.
‚Ä¢ Git: Version control for tracking progress.
‚Ä¢ GitHub: Repository for sharing code and documentation.
‚Ä¢ Flask: For building simple web applications.
‚Ä¢ Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
‚Ä¢ Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.

##üîç Methodology
The course follows a hands-on approach where each day focuses on a new Python concept or project:
‚Ä¢ Day 1-14: Python fundamentals (data types, loops, functions).
‚Ä¢ Day 15-28: Intermediate projects (OOP, error handling).
‚Ä¢ Day 29-42: Advanced concepts (decorators, generators).
‚Ä¢ Day 43-56: API integration and web scraping.
‚Ä¢ Day 57-70: Data science with Pandas and Matplotlib.
‚Ä¢ Day 71-84: Building web applications with Flask.
‚Ä¢ Day 85-100: Capstone projects and final challenges.

##üìä Analysis Steps
1. Daily Practice: Each day includes a new challenge or project to solve, allowing consistent practice and learning.
2. Project-Based Learning: Larger projects integrate multiple concepts, like building a simple web application or a game.
3. Code Reviews: Reviewing past days‚Äô projects to reinforce concepts and identify areas for improvement.
4. Documentation: Writing notes and documenting code to ensure a deeper understanding of each concept.

##üìà Results and Key Findings
‚Ä¢ Increased Proficiency: Noticeable improvements in understanding Python syntax, libraries, and frameworks.
‚Ä¢ Practical Skills: Gained hands-on experience with web development, data analysis, and API integration.
‚Ä¢ Problem-Solving: Enhanced ability to break down complex problems into smaller, manageable coding challenges.

##üí° Recommendations
‚Ä¢ Daily Consistency: Ensure consistent practice by dedicating at least 1 hour each day to complete the day‚Äôs challenge.
‚Ä¢ Engage with Community: Participate in forums and discussions with other learners to gain insights and alternative solutions.
‚Ä¢ Document Learning: Maintain a daily journal or README updates to track progress and reflect on learnings.

üìù Conclusion
The ‚Äú100 Days of Code‚Äù Python Bootcamp is a valuable journey for anyone looking to build or strengthen their Python skills. By breaking down the learning process into manageable daily challenges, the course ensures steady progress and mastery over time. The repository serves as a showcase of the projects and challenges completed during this course, highlighting the skills developed along the way.
